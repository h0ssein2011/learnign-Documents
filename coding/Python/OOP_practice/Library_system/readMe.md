# Library Management System

Create a library management system that allows users to add, remove, and search for books. The system should have the following classes:

1. `Book`: A class that represents a book. It should have attributes such as title, author, ISBN, publisher, and number of pages.

2. `Library`: A class that represents the library. It should have attributes such as a list of books, number of books, and functions to add, remove, and search for books.

3. `User`: A class that represents the library user. It should have attributes such as name, email, and a list of borrowed books. The `User` class should also have functions to borrow and return books.

4. `Admin`: A class that represents the library admin. It should have attributes such as name, email, and a password. The `Admin` class should have functions to add, remove, and search for books, and to add or remove library users.

The program should have a user interface that allows users to interact with the library management system. The user interface should allow users to:

1. View the list of books in the library
2. Add a book to the library
3. Remove a book from the library
4. Search for a book by title, author, or ISBN
5. Borrow a book
6. Return a book
7. Login as an admin

The `Admin` should be able to:

1. Add a book to the library
2. Remove a book from the library
3. Search for a book by title, author, or ISBN
4. Add a user to the library
5. Remove a user from the library
